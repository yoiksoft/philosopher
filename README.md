# Philosopher

Philosopher is the back-end for the Kwot app. It handles creation of all Quotes and Meanings. Submissions for Quote of the Day, voting on Quote of the Day, as well as relationships between users (friendships).

## Documentation

This API is currently in Beta and is subject to change heavily. Documentation was previously written but is now completely out of date. In the future, documentation will be provided on the [Wiki](https://github.com/yoiksoft/philosopher/wiki)
